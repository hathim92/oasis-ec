      "Xbox 360 had some similar features to its predecessor but had higher power with respect to CPU, memory and graphics. Unlike out-of-order execution in Xbox, Xbox 360 made use of in-order execution to reduce the CPU size, complexity and power demands. The motion-sensing peripheral Kinect was introduced, which allowed gamers to play using physical motions rather than using the controllers. Xbox 360 also introduced the non-subscription service called Xbox Live Free. Another new feature that Xbox 360 introduced was the capability of watching movies with the help of the Internet."
          "Xbox One is the third console in the Xbox family. It included a built-in battery for the controller and a much squarer design was adopted. Xbox One fixed some of the reliability issues found in Xbox 360, and is faster and more powerful than its predecessor with exponential increases memory, graphics and CPU. Kinect was no longer an optional feature and the scope of cloud increased with Xbox One. Xbox One is, however, not backward compatible with most games and applications of the previous two members of Xbox family."),
